Launched in 2021 BioIcons is an attempt to make scientific illustrations findable, interoperable, accessible and reusable (FAIR). 

We achieve this using our open source website that is used to host scientific illustrations in the open SVG format from a variety of contributors such as the [Database Center for the Life Sciences](https://togotv.dbcls.jp/en/pics.html), [Servier Medical Art](https://smart.servier.com/) and plenty of individual scientists. 

You can contribute your own illustrations on [https://bioicons.com/submit/](https://bioicons.com/submit/).
